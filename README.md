Daisyworld: A Thermostat Planet

Imagine a simplified Earth simulated by a computer program. This is Daisyworld, where the only life forms are black and white daisies. These daisies play a crucial role in regulating the planet's temperature through a property called albedo. Albedo determines how much sunlight a surface reflects. White daisies, with their high albedo, act like tiny mirrors, reflecting sunlight back into space and keeping things cool. Conversely, black daisies have a low albedo, absorbing more sunlight and warming their surroundings.

A Balancing Act: The Daisy Feedback Loop

This color difference creates a fascinating feedback loop. As the simulated sun gets brighter, the heat triggers the growth of white daisies. Their high albedo cools the planet by reflecting more sunlight. On the flip side, if the sun dims, black daisies take over, absorbing more sunlight to warm things up. This thermostat-like behavior helps maintain a relatively stable temperature on Daisyworld, even with changes in sunlight intensity.

Beyond Daisyworld: Introducing DaisyScape

While Daisyworld offers a simplified view, DaisyScape takes things a step further. Here, the sun's brightness remains constant, but the focus shifts to how the daisies themselves are used. Researchers will explore four different scenarios:

Unrestricted Harvest: Imagine harvesting all daisies, regardless of color. How will this impact the temperature?
Selective White Harvest: What happens if only white daisies are harvested? Will the planet overheat?
Black Market for Black Daisies: In this scenario, only black daisies are harvested. Will the planet enter a perpetual ice age?
White Daisys as "sugar", Black Daisys as spice: This scenario explores a situation where white daisies are considered a valuable resource ("sugar") and black daisies are a desired spice. Will this selective harvesting maintain a stable temperature?

By studying these scenarios in DaisyScape, researchers can gain insights into the potential consequences of exploiting natural resources and how ecosystems might respond.
